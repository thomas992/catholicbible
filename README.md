# DRB & CPDV Bible JSON

This repository provides structured JSON versions of two complete Catholic Bible translations:

- **Douayâ€“Rheims Bible (DRB)**
- **Catholic Public Domain Version (CPDV)**

Each translation has been normalized into a unified schema for ease of use in web and application projects.

## Format

Both JSON files share the same structure:

```json
{
  "books": [
    {
      "name": "Genesis",
      "chapters": [
        {
          "number": 1,
          "verses": [
            { "number": 1, "text": "In the beginning, God created heaven and earth." },
            { "number": 2, "text": "And the earth was void and empty, ..." }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
````
